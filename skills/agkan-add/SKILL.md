# agkan-add

## Overview

A workflow to add a new task to the backlog with all relevant fields set in one pass.

---

## When to Run

- When the user wants to register a new task or idea
- When a new requirement surfaces during development
- When creating a child task under an existing parent

---

## Workflow

### 1. Collect Task Information

Gather the following from the user. Fields marked optional can be skipped if not provided.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Title | Yes | Short, descriptive task title |
| Body | No | Detailed description, background, acceptance criteria |
| Tags | No | One or more from the canonical tag list (see below) |
| Priority | No | `critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low` (default: `medium`) |
| Parent task ID | No | ID of an existing task to nest this task under |

**Canonical tag list (in priority order):**

| Tag | Use when |
|-----|----------|
| `bug` | Something is broken |
| `security` | Security-related concern |
| `improvement` | Enhancement to existing functionality |
| `test` | Test coverage or QA |
| `performance` | Speed or resource optimization |
| `refactor` | Code quality, no behavior change |
| `docs` | Documentation |

### 2. Create the Task

**Single-line body:** Pass directly as an argument.

```bash
agkan task add "<title>" "<body>" --priority <value>
agkan task add "<title>" --priority <value>  # no body
agkan task add "<title>" "<body>"            # medium priority (default, flag omitted)
agkan task add "<title>"
```

**Multi-line body: MUST use `--file`.**

Write the body to a temporary file first, then pass it with `--file`. NEVER use `$'...'` syntax or `\n` in arguments for multi-line content.

```bash
# Step 1: Write body to a temp file (use Write tool)
# /tmp/task_body.md:
# 1行目
# 2行目
#
# ## 詳細
# 内容はここに

# Step 2: Create task with --file
agkan task add "<title>" --file /tmp/task_body.md

# Step 3: Delete the temp file
rm /tmp/task_body.md
```

Note the task ID returned from the command output.

### 3. Attach Tags (if any)

For each tag:

```bash
agkan tag attach <task-id> <tag-name>
```

### 4. Set Parent Task (if applicable)

```bash
agkan task update-parent <task-id> <parent-id>
```

### 5. Set Blocking Dependencies (if applicable)

If this task depends on other tasks (i.e., cannot start until another task is done), set the blocking relationship.

- `<blocker-id>` is the task that must complete first
- `<blocked-id>` is the new task being added

```bash
agkan task block add <blocker-id> <task-id>
```

Ask the user whether there are any tasks this new task is blocked by, or any tasks this new task blocks.

### 6. Show Summary

Retrieve and display the created task:

```bash
agkan task get <task-id>
```

Output a concise summary to the user:

- ID and title
- Status (should be `backlog`)
- Tags attached
- Priority
- Parent task (if set)

---

## Important Notes

- Tasks are always created with `backlog` status by default
- Do not move to `ready` — that is handled by `agkan-planning`
- If the user provides a parent ID, verify it exists before setting the relationship
- When in doubt about tags, ask the user rather than guessing
