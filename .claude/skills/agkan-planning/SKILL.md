# agkan-planning

## Overview

A planning workflow that uses agkan to review backlog tasks and make decisions about decomposition, moving to Ready status, and deferring tasks.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Retrieve Backlog Tasks

```bash
agkan task list --status backlog --json
```

### 2. Review Tasks One by One with Sub-agents

For each task, use the **Task tool (general-purpose sub-agent)** to review.
Do not use `Skill("agkan-planning-subtask")`. Instead, instruct the sub-agent to read the SKILL.md file directly.

> **Why SKILL.md path instead of `Skill()`?**
> Sub-agents spawned via the Task tool start with a fresh context. `Skill()` loads skill content into the current conversation, but a sub-agent needs its instructions embedded in its prompt. Providing the SKILL.md path directly in the prompt is the reliable way to pass workflow instructions to a sub-agent.

```
Task(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  description="Review task #<id>",
  prompt="""
Please review the following backlog task.

## Task Information
- ID: <id>
- Title: <title>
- Body: <body>

## Procedure
Read .claude/skills/agkan-planning-subtask/SKILL.md and follow its procedures to review.
"""
)
```

If a task ID is specified by the user, retrieve and review only that target task:

```bash
agkan task get <id> --json
```

Then delegate only that single task to a sub-agent using the same Task call format above.

### 3. Re-fetch Backlog Tasks and Continue or End Session

After the sub-agent completes, re-fetch the backlog task list to pick up any changes (e.g., tasks added by decomposition):

```bash
agkan task list --status backlog --json
```

If there is no instruction to end from the user and backlog tasks remain, select the next task and repeat from step 2.

If no backlog tasks remain, end the session.

## Decision Flow

```
Retrieve backlog tasks
    ↓
Delegate one task to sub-agent
    ↓
Sub-agent reviews and makes decision
  - Content unclear? → Research code → Add to task
  - Can be decomposed? → Split into subtasks → Close original task
  - Ready to implement now? → Move to Ready
  - Otherwise → Add "will-do-later" tag and keep in Backlog
    ↓
Move to next task (repeat until all are done)
```

---

## Tag Priority

See the canonical definition in `agkan/SKILL.md` (Tag Priority section).

---

## Important Notes

- Tasks with the "will-do-later" tag should be reconsidered after all Ready tasks are completed
- When decomposing tasks, inherit the content from the original task
- Only move to Ready tasks that are "ready to start immediately"
- Icebox tasks are **not** handled by this skill — use `agkan-icebox` to review and promote icebox tasks to backlog first
